Configuration and Installing lib65816
=====================================

To build, I execute the following steps:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cd build
make
```

This should result in two binaries within the `build` directory: `lib65816.a` and `lib65816.so`.

To perform a full system installation, perform this step within `build`:

```sh
sudo make install
```

Uninstalling
============

Inside the `build` directory created above,
you will find a file titled `install_manifest.txt`.
This file lists, one per line, each file installed during a `make install` operation.
At least for Unix systems,
you can uninstall lib65816 by executing the following command:

```sh
xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
```

I don't know the corresponding command for other operating systems.
